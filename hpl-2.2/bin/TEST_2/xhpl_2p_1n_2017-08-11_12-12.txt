Summary: xhpl is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:                                     97.6% |=========|
MPI:                                          2.4% ||
I/O:                                          0.0% |
This application run was Compute-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is in the CPU section below. 
As very little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales.

CPU:
A breakdown of the 97.6% CPU time:
Scalar numeric ops:                           8.3% ||
Vector numeric ops:                          51.7% |====|
Memory accesses:                             40.1% |===|
The CPU performance appears well-optimized for numerical computation. The biggest gains may now come from running at larger scales.
Significant time is spent on memory accesses. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 2.4% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:                     2.1% ||
Time in point-to-point calls:                97.9% |=========|
Effective process collective rate:            0.00 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:         226 MB/s
Most of the time is spent in point-to-point calls with an average transfer rate. Using larger messages and overlapping communication and computation may increase the effective transfer rate.

I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:                                0.0% |
Time in writes:                               0.0% |
Effective process read rate:                  0.00 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:                 0.00 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:                                  0.0% |
Synchronization:                              0.0% |
Physical core utilization:                   99.5% |=========|
System load:                                102.0% |=========|
No measurable time is spent in multithreaded code.

Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:                    59.3 MiB
Peak process memory usage:                    64.5 MiB
Peak node memory usage:                      48.0% |====|
The peak node memory usage is low. Running with fewer MPI processes and more data on each process may be more efficient.

Energy:
A breakdown of how energy was used:

System:                                   not supported
Mean node power:                          not supported
Peak node power:                          not supported
