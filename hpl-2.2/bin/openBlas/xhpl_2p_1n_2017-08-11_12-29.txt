Summary: xhpl is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:                                     75.1% |=======|
MPI:                                         24.9% |=|
I/O:                                      &lt;0.1% ||
This application run was Compute-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is in the CPU section below. 
As little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales.

CPU:
A breakdown of the 75.1% CPU time:
Scalar numeric ops:                           5.9% ||
Vector numeric ops:                          33.4% |==|
Memory accesses:                             45.8% |====|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 24.9% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:                     0.2% ||
Time in point-to-point calls:                99.8% |=========|
Effective process collective rate:            0.00 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:        64.2 MB/s
Most of the time is spent in point-to-point calls with a low transfer rate. This can be caused by inefficient message sizes, such as many small messages, or by imbalanced workloads causing processes to wait.

I/O:
A breakdown of the <0.1% I/O time:
Time in reads:                                0.0% |
Time in writes:                             100.0% |=========|
Effective process read rate:                  0.00 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:                 56.7 kB/s
Most of the time is spent in write operations with a very low effective transfer rate. This may be caused by contention for the filesystem or inefficient access patterns. Use an I/O profiler to investigate which write calls are affected.

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:                                 20.7% |=|
Synchronization:                             79.3% |=======|
Physical core utilization:                   91.8% |========|
System load:                                194.4% |==================|
Significant time is spent synchronizing threads. Check which locks cause the most overhead with a profiler.
The system load is high. Ensure background system processes are not running.

Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:                     176 MiB
Peak process memory usage:                     187 MiB
Peak node memory usage:                      54.0% |====|
The peak node memory usage is modest. Running with fewer MPI processes and more data on each process may be more efficient.

Energy:
A breakdown of how energy was used:

System:                                   not supported
Mean node power:                          not supported
Peak node power:                          not supported
