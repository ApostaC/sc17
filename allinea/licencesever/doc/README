1.  Installing Allinea Licence Server
================================

    To install, run the installer program from the distribution archive.
    You may choose to install just for you or for all users on your system.
    If you are installing on a cluster, please make sure that it is
    available at the same path on every machine.

    If you do not have licence files for each product you will need to obtain them
    from Allinea. Trial licences may be obtained by visiting
      http://www.allinea.com/products/trials/.

    Full licences may be obtained by emailing sales@allinea.com. The licences
    should be stored in a directory called licences below the installation 
    directory. For a default (root) installation, that directory would be:
      /opt/allinea/licenceserver/licences
    and for a user-only installation it would be:
      ${HOME}/allinea/licenceserver/licences

2.  Running Allinea Licence Server
====================

    The Allinea Licence Server user guide in the doc directory contains further configuration
    and startup information.
