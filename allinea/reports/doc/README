1.  Installing Performance Reports
==================================

    Run the graphical "installer" or the text-only "textinstall.sh" from the download
    tarball.

    You may choose to install just for you or for all users on your system.

    If you are installing on a cluster, please make sure the package is
    available at the same path on every machine.

    The user guide in the doc/ directory contains further configuration 
    information.

    If you do not have a licence file you will need to obtain one from Allinea.
    Trial licences may be obtained by visiting
      http://www.allinea.com/products/trials/.

    Full licences may be obtained by emailing sales@allinea.com. The licences
    should be stored in a directory called licences below the installation 
    directory. For a default (root) installation, that directory would be:
      /opt/allinea/reports/licences
    and for a user-only installation it would be:
      ${HOME}/allinea/reports/licences

2.  Running Performance Reports
===============================

    To run Performance Reports, add 'perf-report' in front of your existing
    mpiexec or aprun command-line, e.g.:
        {allinea-reports-path}/bin/perf-report mpiexec -n 4 examples/wave_c

    If {allinea-reports-path}/bin is in your $PATH, just 'perf-report' will do.

    Your chosen program will be run just as before and two report files, one
    .txt and one .html will be created in the current directory on completion.
    If you have problems starting your program under Performance Reports,
    first ensure it can run without Performance Reports with no errors.

    You can use the --output/-o argument to specify a single output file name.
    See perf-report --help or the user guide in doc/ for more information.
